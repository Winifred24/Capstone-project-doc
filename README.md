# Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health
## Overview
This project explores how remote and hybrid work environments affect employee mental well-being across industries, job roles, and demographics. Using a dataset of 5,000 global employees, I conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover trends in stress levels, job satisfaction, and social isolation.
The analysis was performed using Microsoft Power BI, and strategic recommendations were made to guide organizations in designing healthier, more productive work environments.
## Dataset Summary
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- Employee_ID: Unique identifier for each employee
- Age: Employee's age
- Gender: Employee gender identity
- Job_Role: Employee’s role in the organization
- Industry: Industry the employee works in
- Work_Location: Work arrangement (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite)
- Stress_Level: Self-reported (High, Medium, Low)
- Mental_Health_Condition: Reported conditions (e.g., Anxiety, Depression)
- Social_Isolation_Rating: Scale of 1–5
- Satisfaction_with_Remote_Work: Satisfaction level (Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied)
  ## Key Insights
- 🔹 **Remote workers show the highest levels of stress** (≈34.4%)
- 🔹 **Mental health conditions are widespread across all industries**
- 🔹 **Younger employees feel more isolated**, especially when remote
- 🔹 **High stress correlates with lower remote work satisfaction**
- 🔹 **Average isolation rating** is 2.99 (moderate)
- 🔹 **Average employee age** is 41
